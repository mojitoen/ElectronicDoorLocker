# Electronic Door Lock

In an attempt to better my understanding of electronics and it's connection to code, i'm attempting to build a cheap, affordable electronic door lock which will connect 
to a keypad(digital, kotlin based app). 

The idea is to have an app connect to a node.js server(express) and if input is correct, send a signal along to an arduino chip which will unlock/lock an electronic lock.

This is the basis XML for the app in question. No functionality as of yet.
